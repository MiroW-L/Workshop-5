## Introduction
- During Workshop 5, the task involved coding a graph, and I was determined on visualizing my sleep schedule. I remembered how I have kept an article 'Adolescents sleeping problems', and I thought of why not record my sleep schedule, and make it a graph. Specifically, I want to show my hours I slept in the afternoon and at night over everyday and including free time. As on sleeping problems, this project provided an opportunity to analyze and reflect on my sleeping patterns. Through coding, I was able to record my personal data into a presentation, allowing me to understand on how I managed and plus responding to sleep conflicts.
- As searching for 'how to make a graph p5js', there were other graphs that were already made:

- I also thought about a graph, I wanted to make that looks like a star teller.

- During working a code, somehow there were a lot of errors happening for workshop 4, and I was barely stuck. Looking into workshop 5 https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-2-overview?module_item_id=2435968 and even writing the code down what leo did, somehow have gone errors, so I decided to get help from Chatgpt and plus a friend, altogether as again additional help from last time, and fixing errors.  
- Using the help, to display little details on making the graph, it was quite helpful on what the app explained. And it showed like this:
