# Miro Fork (28/1/25)
- I've begun by forking Jinhee Yi's sleep chart to be able to play with the data. I personally feel like this specific workshop, which requires data that represents something personal, it is helpful for me to build off of someone else's ideas because I am not the greatest at using tables and I think a foundation will give me a boost. I think it could be interesting if I were to add my own sleep schedule to Jinhee Yi's chart, possibly in the same way Leo put the fruit into rows at the end of the guide.

- I rewatched the guide on workshop 5 and copied what Leo made and then changed around a lot of the variables within the funtion allMySleep (my variation on Leo's allMyFruit function seen in the guide).

- This was very fun to use and see how the data could be changed around the screen, whether that be with size or x/y position changes, it all made the images move about in a really interesting way that made me really think about how data gets reprosented in media/society.

- Finally I want to see if the data is capable of being animated to move about, I'm going to try make a simple movement for it so it moves across the screen.
