# Miro Fork (28/1/25)
- I've begun by forking Jinhee Yi's sleep chart to be able to play with the data. I personally feel like this specific workshop, which requires data that represents something personal, it is helpful for me to build off of someone else's ideas because I am not the greatest at using tables and I think a foundation will give me a boost. I think it could be interesting if I were to add my own sleep schedule to Jinhee Yi's chart, possibly in the same way Leo put the fruit into rows at the end of the guide.
