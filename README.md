## Introduction
- During Workshop 5, the task involved coding a graph, and I was determined on visualizing my sleep schedule. I remembered how I have kept an article 'Adolescents sleeping problems', and I thought of why not record my sleep schedule, and make it a graph. Specifically, I want to display my hours I slept in the afternoon and at night over a given period. As on sleeping problems, this project provided an opportunity to analyze and reflect on my sleeping patterns. Through coding, I was able to translate this personal data into a visual representation, allowing me to better understand how I manage and respond to sleep conflicts. 
- As searching for 'how to make a graph p5js', there were other graphs that were already made:
